# Session Manager Implementation

A session manager for persistent storage and management of conversations (from qv-ollama-sdk) in an SQLite database. The goal is a simple, efficient, and minimalist solution.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Analysis of requirements and comparison with existing code (qv-ollama-sdk, qv-ollama-simple-ui)
- [x] Design of the data model for SQLite (conversations, messages, metadata)
- [x] Implementation of the SessionManager class (save, load, list, delete, search)
- [x] Integration of time/ID search and resume functionality
- [x] Test cases for the most important functions
- [x] Extend Conversation and Message with methods for full serialization/deserialization for database storage (e.g. to_db_dict, from_db_dict)
- [x] Create a practical demo/example for usage with qv-ollama-sdk
- [x] README.md with installation instructions and usage examples
- [x] Implement backward compatibility for database schema migration

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] README.md with installation instructions and usage examples

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Extension with additional search/filter functions
- [ ] Optional encryption of stored data
- [ ] Export/import of conversations (e.g. as JSON)

## Implementation Plan

- The data model is based on the Conversation and Message objects from qv-ollama-sdk.
- Messages are stored individually in the database to allow flexible display and search (analogous to the UI logic in qv-ollama-simple-ui).
- The SessionManager class encapsulates all database operations and provides methods for saving, loading, listing, searching, and deleting conversations.
- The implementation uses only the Python standard library (sqlite3).
- Focus on clarity, efficiency, and extensibility.
